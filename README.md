# Python Developer Assessment
This repository is for my developer assessment tasks

PHASE 1 — Setup & Foundations
**1.1 Environment Setup**

Set up Python and your IDE (VS Code or PyCharm).

Create a project folder and a simple hello.py program.

Run the script to confirm your environment works.

**1.2 Git & GitHub Basics**

Create a GitHub repository.

Initialize Git locally and connect it to GitHub.

Add initial files and push to main.

Create a new branch (task-1.2-git-basics), update README, commit, and push.

**1.3 Code Style & Linting**

Install Black (formatter) and Flake8 (linter).

Create a branch (task-1.3-code-style).

Write poorly formatted code, then:

Run Flake8

Run Black

Fix remaining issues manually

Commit and push.

PHASE 2 — Core Python Concepts

**2.1 Data Structures & Algorithms**

Create a branch (task-2.1-dsa).

Write two functions:

Filter and sort even numbers

Character frequency counter

Test them and push the code.

**2.2 Object-Oriented Programming**

Create a branch (task-2.2-oop).

Implement a Book class with attributes, age calculation, and summary.

Create example objects, print values, commit, push.

**2.3 Error Handling & Debugging**

Create a branch (task-2.3-error-debug).

Fix a logical error with try-except.

Add a function that safely accesses list elements with error handling.

Test and push.

PHASE 3 — Integration & Finalization

**3.1 API Interaction**

Create a branch (task-3.1-api-interaction).

Use the requests library to fetch user data from an API.

Print selected user details.

Add error handling.

Commit and push.

3.2 Final Submission

Switch to main.

Merge all task branches one by one.

Resolve merge conflicts if they appear.

Update README with:

Project summary
